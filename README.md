# ClipboardManager
ClipboardManager is an MacOS app that allow you to save your copy-paste history! It can save up to 8 strings whenever you copy text. The app itself is lightweight and uses minimal memory. 

## Features
- Stores up to 8 copied text
- Clear Clipboard History (âŒ˜C) - erases clipboard history and current clipboard

## Limitations
- This app is not published as I do not have a membership in the Apple Developer Program. Thus, it is not released for public download. However, feel free to look through the code if you want to make something similar.
- As I do not have access to special benefits in the Apple Developer Program, this app cannot update on background refresh. Thus, it cannot auto-update your clipboard history every time you copy a text. You will have to manually update by clicking "Update Clipboard History" on the menu.
